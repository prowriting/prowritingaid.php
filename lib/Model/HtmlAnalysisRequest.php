If you would like a different report, or require extra information, such as tokenization, sentence split, parts of speech, etc. then please [get in touch](https://prowritingaid.com/en/Home/Contact).

Alliterations are a linguistic tool used by some writers for effect.. |  allrepeats | Development | Highlights words and phrases that you&#39;ve used repeatedly in your text. |  allsentences | Live | Shows a visual representation of the sentences lengths of your writing.

Try and think of something else to say.. |  complex | Live | Highlights complex words in your writing. Words are broken down by number of syllables.. |  consistency | Live | Highlights inconsistency in your text.

If you are analyzing a document written by someone else then this will give you an idea of their preferred representational system. This may help you tailor your writing in order to build rapport. If you don&#39;t know the modality of your reader then try to use a balance of words from each modality.
